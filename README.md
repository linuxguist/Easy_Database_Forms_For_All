## Direct Download Link ( Right Click to "Open Link in New Tab" ) : https://sourceforge.net/projects/easy-database-forms-for-all/files/latest/download

Please watch the video/screenshots below for easy installation steps. This video is taken from my other project, with many similarities and some naming differences.

After installation, login to the Administration Page with :

Username : root  

Password : change_this

and look at the team1 database and the sample_table in it.

You can now create your own required tables/forms.

Also, login into the team1 user page ( from homepage ) with :

Username : team1  

Password : change_this

to check its facilities.

You can also create your own users, databases, grant privileges, change passwords, enable audits, create tables etc. by having a look at this file : C:\forms\httpd\htdocs\team1_user_and_database_creation.sql

Also, the files, index.html and the team[1-8].php present in the same folder, can be studied for more customization. Use a good Text / Code Editor Software like "Sublime Text" OR Notepad++ to open these files. Check Google For Them.

## Features:

The Web Server & Database Server included in the package can work on both Windows 32 & Windows 64 Bit Operating Systems.

The Application Logins mentioned above will only work on the secure https connection and not on the insecure http connection.

As this system is meant for local network usage, it uses a self-signed https certificate. Hence, browsers will throw a warning for the first time. Please accept the same and proceed ahead.

Please save this webpage completely, for future references.

This is also a Quick LAMP / WAMP / MAMP / XAMPP Package for development, testing & production

While creating multiple tables for a neat data seggregation, you may consider creating foreign keys in them, to reference their source data tables. Here are some adminer links, that refer to the same :   https://sourceforge.net/p/adminer/discussion/960418/thread/45948f44/  and https://sourceforge.net/p/adminer/discussion/960418/thread/61338c39a2/

Also, refer the screenshots of my other project, for an understanding of how data is normally seggregated into multiple tables and creating foreign keys between them, help in automatically generating and populating list boxes, while inputting records, here : https://sourceforge.net/projects/irbsystem/

Creating Foreign keys also help immensly in maintaining uniformity of data input and prevents varied / spelling mistake prone data inputs.
